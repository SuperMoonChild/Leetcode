Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

#two pointer solution
#swap the elemtn in the string and we can achieve the O(n) and O(1) time and space complexity respectively 

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        b = 0 
        e = len(s) - 1 

        while b < e: 
            s[b],s[e] = s[e],s[b]
            b+=1
            e-=1 
        
        return s
